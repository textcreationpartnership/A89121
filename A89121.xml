            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACcording to your deſire, expreſſed in the laſt, I ſhall
here give you a juſt account of the Armies procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings at this inſtant,
(which I believe are contrary many mens expectation) they behave themſelves
very gallantly, injuring no man, they preſerve much, but ſpoyleth little,
their deportment is ſo fair, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants <pb facs="tcp:160303:3"/>hereabouts,
that they embrace them as boſome friends, more liker then ſtrangers.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>It hath been rumoured abroad, that the Army intends to advance
neerer London within few dayes, and ſome talk there is of a ſurrounding;
but I will wave my pen in this, becauſe it ſounds to me with a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eccho, for I never heard it from any, but only ſome few private Souldiers.
The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is ſaid to bee about twenty thouſand (beſides the additionall
Forces which are lately joyned with them) and indeed I can not conceive how
they can amount to leſſe, but rather more; for the whole Body of the Army
is drawn into 20 Regiments, 8 of horſe, and 12 of Foot, each Regiment of foot
conſiſting of 1200 hundred, and each Company belonging to every Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
amounts to eightſcore, a Lieutenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colonels company ſevenſcore, a Majors
company ſixeſcore, and every Captaines company one hundred, containing
ſeven in number, throughout every Regiment in the Army.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:160303:3"/>
               <p>The horſe are ſuppoſed to be about ſeven thouſand, and
(as I ſuppoſe) as brave a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade as Europe can afford, being indued with
many excellent and divine gifts, both for valour, prudence, and pious actions,
injuring no man, but planting peace and unity where they diſcern the
ſpringing up of diſcord and contention. They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the
countries adjoyning their candid intentions and reſolutions in this their
preſent deſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
ſhewing that all their endeavours and actions are onely for the ſetling of
a ſafe and well-grounded peace within this his Majeſties Realme &amp;
Dominion.</p>
               <p>We hear that there is a party of horſe &amp; Dragoones
advanced into Kent, and that divers Regiments of horſe and foote are
quartered about Reading, Windſor, and thoſe parts; ſome reports alſo of
a Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz appointed by the whole Army upon Hounſlo-heath, towards the
latter end of this inſtant Moneth: the Committee of the Army ſits very
cloſe, having (as they ſay) ſome weighty particulars to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb facs="tcp:160303:4"/>to the houſe touching the eleven Members
impeached.</p>
               <p>Colonell Rainsboroughes Regiment, who by order of both houſes
of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were appointed for the Weſtern ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, are returned from
Portsmouth, and come again to the Army, leaving all their Commanders behind
them, except ſome few inferiour Officers, what their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, time
wil make manifeſt. There are alſo divers other parties which were
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Ireland, come back to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; ſaying, they will not engage
for that ſervice, untill this Kingdome bee ſetled in peace.</p>
               <p>We hear of the Trayn of Artillery being drawn out of Oxford to
the Generals head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters at St. Albanes, together with ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Demy
Culverans, ten Sakers, fifteene Drakes, fifteen ſmal Field-pieces, with great
ſtore of Ammunition, all which (is ſaid) was conducted to St. Albans by a
party of horſe appointed for that purpoſe; what the iſſue of this will
be, I cannot as yet diſcover; but my prayers ſhall bee, that peace and
unity <pb facs="tcp:160303:4"/>may flouriſh, and ſtrife and
diſcord abandoned, and that a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence may be had betwixt the
Parlirment, City and Army, that ſo all things may be compoſed in love,
without any more bloud-ſhed.</p>
               <p>Here is much talk in the Army of the Golden Butter-firkins, that
were lately ſtayed at Graveſ-end, and of the politick deſignes of thoſe
famous Chermers, which are ſaid to be men of eminency: the army is very
inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive to to find out the actors, it will fall heavie upon ſome, it
is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But time gives an allarm now to with draw, therefore for
